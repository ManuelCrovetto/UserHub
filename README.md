# UserHub Release notes

### Introduction:
Random users list generated by RandomUser.Me backend, displayed in a list using Pagination, implementing Pager 3, fun and efficient library! :)

### Getting started with the app notes:
As the Google Maps API Key is not loaded in the repository, you won't be able to run the app directly out of the box. Please create a variable named google_api_key in your local.properties file, and assign it either a fake API key or a Google Maps API Key to be able to run the project. 
To see Google Maps working, please try the APK loaded in the repository (APK).
